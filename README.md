Prerequisites
=============

Custom version of NS-3 (tagged as `ns-3.23-dev-ndnSIM-2.1`) and ndnSIM 2.1 (tagged as `ndnSIM-2.1`)
needs to be installed.

The code should also work with the latest version of ndnSIM, but it is not guaranteed.

    mkdir ns-dev
    cd ns-dev

    git clone https://github.com/named-data-ndnSIM/ns-3-dev ns-3
              Optional:(cd ns-3; git checkout ns-3.23-dev-ndnSIM-2.1)
    git clone -b ndnSIM-2.1 --recursive https://github.com/named-data-ndnSIM/ndnSIM ns-3/src/ndnSIM
              Optional:(cd ns-3/src/ndnSIM; git checkout ndnSIM-2.1)

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/named-data-ndnSIM/scenario-ndn-ping

    cd ns-3
    ./waf configure -d optimized
    ./waf
    sudo ./waf install

    cd ../scenario-ndn-ping

After which you can proceed to compile and run the code

For more information how to install NS-3 and ndnSIM, please refer to http://ndnsim.net website.

Compiling
=========

To configure in optimized mode without logging **(default)**:

    ./waf configure

To configure in optimized mode with scenario logging enabled (logging in NS-3 and ndnSIM modules will
still be disabled, but you can see output from NS_LOG* calls from your scenarios and extensions):

    ./waf configure --logging

To configure in debug mode with all logging enabled

    ./waf configure --debug

If you have installed NS-3 in a non-standard location, you may need to set up ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH``
variable.

Running
=======

You can run the ping scenario by typing

    ./waf --run ping-simple

    # or
    # ./build/ping-simple
